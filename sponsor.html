      <p>
      The <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos Family</a> of Companies, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, is a leader in online apparel and footwear sales by striving to provide shoppers the best possible service and selection. We carry millions of products from over 1000 footwear and apparel brands. Established in 1999, we are currently located in Las Vegas, NV, Shepherdsville, KY, and with a brand-spanking new extension software development shop, we're back in our "hometown," San Francisco, CA. There are approximately 2,500 Zapponians, but continual growth makes that number ever-increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
      We've been asked by a lot of people how we've grown so quickly, and the answer is actually really simple...we've aligned the entire organization around one mission: to provide the best customer service possible. Internally, we call this our WOW philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
      And, we believe that it's our unique, "fun and a little weird" culture that drives the WOW. In January 2011, Zappos earned #6 on the 2010 Fortune: 100 Best Companies to Work For List, and our sales exceed 1 billion dollars a year. We think we might be on to something here...

      <p>
      In 2009, the founders of Grasshopper saw the need for a modern Software-as-a-Service offering to meet the needs of businesses that need to manage subscriptions and bill customers. The market seemed to be filled with clunky, off-the-shelf systems and enterprise solutions that charged huge set up and transaction fees. So, they decided to build an intelligent billing application system themselves, and Chargify was born.
      </p>
      <p>
      Developed by a team with more than twenty years of combined experience, Chargify is a reliable web-based service (Ruby on Rails framework, simple API, self-service business model) operated within a solid corporate structure (experienced staff and solid financials). We know the unique demands a business can face when it comes to billing and that's why we're committed to providing a truly outstanding recurring billing application engineered for the long-haul.
      </p>
      <p>
      The team was joined by Lance Walley in 2009, co-founder and former CEO of Engine Yard, a well-known company in the Ruby on Rails hosting market.

      <p>At SendGrid, we believe that the easiest and most effective method of communication a business has with its customers is email. On average, 20% of emails sent by web applications either go missing or they get caught by spam filters. What is the impact of  a 20% loss in communication to your business?</p> 
 
    <p>SendGrid has developed a cloud based service that solves this challenge by
      delivering emails on behalf of companies. We've already helped over 8,000
      companies and delivered over 2 Billion emails. Isn't it time that you can
      return your focus to the core of your business, and let our team
      take good care of your email? <a title="testimonials" href="http://www.sendgrid.com/testimonials.html">think so</a>... <a title="let's get started" href="http://www.sendgrid.com/pricing.html">let's get started</a>, for free, if you like.</p>

      <p>
      We created manpacks to give men (and the people who love them) more time to build empires, climb mountains, slay dragons... to achieve the goals they aspire to.  We believe...<br>

      Men have better things to do than shop for the basics.<br>
      The people who love them have better things to do, too.<br>
      To the extent that we outsource the mundane, we liberate ourselves.<br>

      <p>Headquartered in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Sierra Trading Post is a multichannel retailer known nationwide for offering "Great Deals on Great Brands."  By purchasing brand name overstocks, closeouts and 2nds, we are able to pass great deals on to our customers â€” selling outdoor gear, shoes, men's clothing, women's clothing, accessories and home furnishings at 35 to 70% savings every day.  Sierra Trading Post works with more than 1,000 great brands that think of us first when they have closeouts to sell. Some of those brands include Columbia Sportswear, The North Face, Keen, Carhartt, Asolo, ExOfficio, New Balance, SmartWool, Ecco, Merrell, Mountain Hardwear and Lowe Alpine.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although we now sell product worldwide, the company began in 1986 as a modest family operation and outlet store in Reno, Nevada. In 1992, Owner and Founder Keith Richardson opened the second outlet store in Cheyenne, Wyoming and later opened two additional outlet stores, which are located in Boise, Idaho and Cody, Wyoming, with around-the-clock customer service call centers in Cheyenne and Cody. Still very much a family-operated company today, Sierra Trading Post has grown tremendously over the years, and now employs more than 600 people, 500 of which work at the Cheyenne headquarters.

      <p>
      SwarmBuilder.com is focused on aggregating important sales influencers AND delivering "incentivized" Word-of-Mouth Marketing (WOMM) services. We work with Brands, Retailers and Member Organizations to build audiences of sales influencers and convert them into active armies of engaged Brand Advocates resulting in millions of WOMM-inspired interactions each year.
      </p> 
      <p>
      We focus on three types of sales influencers: 1) Retail Sales Professionals; 2) Pros and other VIPs; 3) vocal web collaborators. For each group, we have developed a tailored site (3point5.com and ProMotive.com). All three sites run on our powerful, proprietary platform, which enables the execution of efficient and effective WOMM initiatives while minimizing administrative costs and user abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
      Today the SwarmBuilder team works with almost 200 Brands that operate in a wide range of consumer product industries. We develop and deliver millions of training sessions to almost 20,000 retail locations annually. We also seed and gather feedback from our hundreds-of-thousands of Brand Advocates.

We are WOMM believers. We are web-savvy, service-oriented professionals. And we are consumer product junkies. Want to learn more? Take a demo, give us a call, or drop us an email.
