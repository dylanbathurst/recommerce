      <p>
      The <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos Family</a> of Companies, a subsidiary of <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, is a leader in online apparel and footwear sales by striving to provide shoppers the best possible service and selection. We carry millions of products from over 1000 footwear and apparel brands. Established in 1999, we are currently located in Las Vegas, NV, Shepherdsville, KY, and with a brand-spanking new extension software development shop, we're back in our "hometown," San Francisco, CA. There are approximately 2,500 Zapponians, but continual growth makes that number ever-increasing.
      </p>
      <p>
      We've been asked by a lot of people how we've grown so quickly, and the answer is actually really simple...we've aligned the entire organization around one mission: to provide the best customer service possible. Internally, we call this our WOW philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
      And, we believe that it's our unique, "fun and a little weird" culture that drives the WOW. In January 2011, Zappos earned #6 on the 2010 Fortune: 100 Best Companies to Work For List, and our sales exceed 1 billion dollars a year. We think we might be on to something here...

      <p>
      In 2009, the founders of Grasshopper saw the need for a modern Software-as-a-Service offering to meet the needs of businesses that need to manage subscriptions and bill customers. The market seemed to be filled with clunky, off-the-shelf systems and enterprise solutions that charged huge set up and transaction fees. So, they decided to build an intelligent billing application system themselves, and Chargify was born.
      </p>
      <p>
      Developed by a team with more than twenty years of combined experience, Chargify is a reliable web-based service (Ruby on Rails framework, simple API, self-service business model) operated within a solid corporate structure (experienced staff and solid financials). We know the unique demands a business can face when it comes to billing and that's why we're committed to providing a truly outstanding recurring billing application engineered for the long-haul.
      </p>
      <p>
      The team was joined by Lance Walley in 2009, co-founder and former CEO of Engine Yard, a well-known company in the Ruby on Rails hosting market.

      <p>At SendGrid, we believe that the easiest and most effective method of communication a business has with its customers is email. On average, 20% of emails sent by web applications either go missing or they get caught by spam filters. What is the impact of  a 20% loss in communication to your business?</p> 
 
    <p>SendGrid has developed a cloud based service that solves this challenge by
      delivering emails on behalf of companies. We've already helped over 8,000
      companies and delivered over 2 Billion emails. Isn't it time that you can
